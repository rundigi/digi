# Welcome to Digi

Digi is a **self-hosted Platform as a Service** (PaaS) similar to Railway or Render, but fully under your control. Deploy apps directly from GitHub repositories or Docker images onto Proxmox VMs with zero configuration.

## What Digi Does

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deploy from GitHub" icon="github">
    Connect your repo and deploy with a single command. Digi uses Railpack buildpacks for automatic build detection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Docker Image Support" icon="docker">
    Deploy any Docker image from any registry. Full support for private registries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic SSL" icon="lock">
    Caddy handles SSL termination automatically. Every service gets a subdomain with HTTPS.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Built-in" icon="credit-card">
    Stripe-powered billing with plans, subscriptions, and usage-based pricing.
  </Card>

## Architecture Overview

Digi runs on your own infrastructure:

- **Proxmox VE** — VM orchestration
- **Caddy** — Reverse proxy and SSL (master + per-VM)
- **Cloudflare** — DNS management
- **PostgreSQL** — Primary database
- **Redis** — Caching, pub/sub, job queue

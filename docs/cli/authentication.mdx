# CLI Authentication

## Login

```bash
digi login
```

This opens your browser to authorize the CLI. After approving, your token is saved locally.

## Token Storage

Tokens are stored in `~/.config/digi/credentials.json`.

## Using API Tokens

You can also authenticate with a pre-generated API token:

```bash
export DIGI_TOKEN=your_token_here
digi services list
```

Or per-command:

```bash
digi --token your_token_here services list
```

## Logout

```bash
digi logout
```

Removes stored credentials.

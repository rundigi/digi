# Self-Hosting Digi

Digi is designed to be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. You have full control over your data and compute.

## Architecture

```
Internet → Cloudflare DNS → Master Caddy → Digi API
                                        → Per-VM Caddy → Docker Containers
```

## Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Proxmox VE | VM orchestration |
| Caddy (master) | Global reverse proxy, SSL termination |
| Caddy (per-VM) | Per-VM service routing |
| Cloudflare | DNS management, DDoS protection |
| PostgreSQL | Primary database |
| Redis | Cache, pub/sub, job queue |

## Requirements

- A Proxmox VE cluster (or single node)
- A domain with Cloudflare DNS
- A PostgreSQL instance
- A Redis instance
- A server to run the Digi API and dashboards
